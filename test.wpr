general lexicon
    ~ => pre-processing: used for establishing local variables and intial operations
    - => pre-subsitution: used for calculating results on record-level
    + => post-subsitution: used for calculating results from output of record-level
    * => post-processing: used for aggregate functions
    anything else => comment/ignored

    {variable} => value at 'variable'
    [variable] => outputs 'variable'
    [{variable}] => outputs value at 'variable'

    {0}, {1}, .. {n} are reserved for record values at given index
    {a..b} refers to all records from index a to index b (inclusive). a doesn't need be lesser than b
    binary +,-,*,/ operators implicitly converts arguments into ints and produces a string output
    |length| is a shorthand for length of string 'length'

~{x},{y}
    the ~ here denotes variables that exist within scope of this script
    it can also denote operations done prior to processing in general

    establishes x and y as variables in local scope
-{{x} = int{0} + int{1}}
    the - here denotes operations to be done prior to token subsitution per record

    calculates x (string) as the sum of {0} + {1} numerically
+[x]{{y}={4}{0}}[y]
    the + here denotes operations to be done immediately after token subsitution per record
    
    prints x, calculates y as the concatination of {4} and {0}, then prints y
*[{|{1}|}]
    the * here denotes operations done at the end of processing or as an aggregate over every record
    
    |{1}| here is a shorthand for the average of the 2nd column (index 1).
    It then prints the evaluated value
